Data Structures
- Logical organisation of the data
- Physical memory which stores the data

How we store the data depends on how we want to access the data and what we are interested in

Fundamental Data Structures
- Ways of imposing order on a collection of information
- list, stacks and queues (linear)
- trees (hierarchical in nature)
- hash tables (relational in nature; mapping relationships i.e. Dictionaries)

Compare data structures and algorithms imples we have the ability to measure the efficiency
- Big O

High Level Programming Languages
- Provides a higher level abstratcion from the underlying hardware
-- Allows symbolic names to represent memory cells
-- Operations fo not depend on instruction set
-- I/O is independent of the I/O device

Python == Interpreted language implemention (line-by-line)
Java == Compiled language implementation

- Java programs are organised as classes stored in files with the ".java" extension
- Class name is same as the file name
- Curly braces enclose classes and methods
- Method ("function") within the class

Classes are only used to define new custom data types (Python)
- not all programs need a class
- the program can run without pre-processing it (executable from the shell)

Classes define data types but they also serve as "containers" for other code
- Every program needs ar leasy one mehtod called main()
- In java the program will be default begin with main
